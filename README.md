# Efficient-Data-Stream-Anomaly-Detection
A Python-based system for real-time anomaly detection in continuous data streams, simulating patterns and flagging outliers. Features live data visualization and efficient anomaly analysis.
This project requires the following Python libraries: Flask, a lightweight web framework for server creation and routing; NumPy, used for numerical computing and array handling; and Matplotlib, which generates real-time plots for data visualization. To install these libraries, run the command pip install Flask numpy matplotlib.
